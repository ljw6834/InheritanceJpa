This project is using JPA single table strategy to map class hierarchy: the entities from different classes with a common ancestor are placed 
in a single table. 
It uses specification to query attributes from super class as well as from subclass. 
In ArtPieceSpecificatoin, builder.treat() is used to change to subclass domain in order to get the attribute on it. 
Root<Painting> paintingRoot = builder.treat(root, Painting.class);
